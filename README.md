# Programming 2 @ KTH

This code was written by me in 2015 in the course "programmering 2" at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.
Some of the code was provided for the tasks by the teachers and I've been reluctant to publish this code for a long time due to that and the fact that the same tasks were repeatedly used the year after. As the tasks are to my knowledge no longer graded, I feel as if I can make this code publicly available as well.

The interesting part is probably the reports (in swedish) I wrote rather than the code they belong to.
